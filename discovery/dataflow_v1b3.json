The exact way in which the original task is decomposed into the two parts is specified either as a position demarcating them (stop_position), or explicitly as two DerivedSources, if this task consumes a user-defined source type (dynamic_source_split). The \"current\" task is adjusted as a result of the split: after a task with range [A, B) sends a stop_position update at C, its range is considered to be [A, C), e.g.: * Progress should be interpreted relative to the new range, e.g. \"75% completed\" means \"75% of [A, C) completed\" * The worker should interpret proposed_stop_position relative to the new range, e.g. \"split at 68%\" should be interpreted as \"split at 68% of [A, C)\". * If the worker chooses to split again using stop_position, only stop_positions in [A, C) will be accepted. * Etc. dynamic_source_split has similar semantics: e.g., if a task with source S splits using dynamic_source_split into {P, R} (where P and R must be together equivalent to S), then subsequent progress and proposed_stop_position should be interpreted relative to P, and in a potential subsequent dynamic_source_split into {P', R'}, P' and R' must be together equivalent to P, etc.",

Examples: * If we are processing record #30 (starting at 1) out of 50 in a perfectly splittable 50-record input, this value should be 21 (20 remaining + 1 current). * If we are reading through block 3 in a block-compressed file consisting of 5 blocks, this value should be 3 (since blocks 4 and 5 can be processed in parallel by new tasks via dynamic splitting and the current task remains processing block 3). * If we are reading through the last block in a block-compressed file, or reading or processing the last record in a perfectly splittable input, this value should be 1, because apart from the current task, no additional remainder can be split off."
