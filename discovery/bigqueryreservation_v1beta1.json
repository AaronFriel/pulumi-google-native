Currently a resource (project, folder, organization) can only have one assignment per each (job_type, location) combination, and that reservation will be used for all jobs of the matching type. Different assignments can be created on different levels of the projects, folders or organization hierarchy. During query execution, the assignment is looked up at the project, folder and organization levels in that order. The first assignment found is applied to the query. When creating assignments, it does not matter if other assignments exist at higher levels. Example: * The organization `organizationA` contains two projects, `project1` and `project2`. * Assignments for all three entities (`organizationA`, `project1`, and `project2`) could all be created and mapped to the same or different reservations. \"None\" assignments represent an absence of the assignment. Projects assigned to None use on-demand pricing. To create a \"None\" assignment, use \"none\" as a reservation_id in the parent. Example parent: `projects/myproject/locations/US/reservations/none`. Returns `google.rpc.Code.PERMISSION_DENIED` if user does not have 'bigquery.admin' permissions on the project using the reservation and the project that owns this reservation.

Commitments can be removed after their commitment end time passes. In order to remove annual commitment, its plan needs to be changed to monthly or flex first. A capacity commitment resource exists as a child resource of the admin project."
