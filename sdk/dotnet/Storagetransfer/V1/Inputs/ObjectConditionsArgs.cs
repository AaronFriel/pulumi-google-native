If `include_prefixes` is not specified, all objects except those that have names starting with one of the `exclude_prefixes` must satisfy the object conditions. Requirements: * Each include-prefix and exclude-prefix can contain any sequence of Unicode characters, to a max length of 1024 bytes when UTF8-encoded, and must not contain Carriage Return or Line Feed characters. Wildcard matching and regular expression matching are not supported. * Each include-prefix and exclude-prefix must omit the leading slash. For example, to include the `requests.gz` object in a transfer from `s3://my-aws-bucket/logs/y=2015/requests.gz`, specify the include prefix as `logs/y=2015/requests.gz`. * None of the include-prefix or the exclude-prefix values can be empty, if specified. * Each include-prefix must include a distinct portion of the object namespace. No include-prefix may be a prefix of another include-prefix. * Each exclude-prefix must exclude a distinct portion of the object namespace. No exclude-prefix may be a prefix of another exclude-prefix. * If `include_prefixes` is specified, then each exclude-prefix must start with the value of a path explicitly included by `include_prefixes`. The max size of `include_prefixes` is 1000.
